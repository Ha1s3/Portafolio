                  Hello! I am Juan Pablo Delgadillo Flores.
              </p>
              <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  For over two years, I have been dedicating myself to developing and honing my logical and creative skills in the field of software development. My interest in this area stemmed from my academic pursuit of a degree in Software Development and Management Engineering, and since then, I have discovered a profound passion for programming and significant potential for my professional future.

                  I thoroughly enjoy acquiring new knowledge and am particularly drawn to web technologies. Therefore, I have chosen to specialize in web design and programming. I find great satisfaction in working on projects that demand a combination of technical and creative skills, and I am consistently seeking new challenges to enhance my knowledge and abilities in this field.
